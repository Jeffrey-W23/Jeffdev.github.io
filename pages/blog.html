                            <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom:5px;">Freedom means a lot to me, so I needed to embrace it before it's stolen again.</p>

                            <!-- Main post content -->
                            <p>It's been a few weeks since I made a post here, so I wanted to make a quick update today on where I have been the last few weeks, but most importantly, an update on my development over that time.</p>
                            <p>Just a few days after my last post here on the blog, my home state of Victoria came out of lockdown, and I had an opportunity to finally see my friends and family again for the first time in almost a year. I decided to take this time and relax, no development, just fun times with the people that matter most.</p>
                            <p>Development during this time mostly involved solving a few small problems, mainly attempting and then reversing an upgrade to Netcode for GameObjects (More on that later). But other than a failed attempt to upgrade the multiplayer system, the equipping system for items seems to be working well and shooting and other weapons/equipable item functions are now the current focus. Sadly it's not a lot of progress for the month of November, but it's been a rough year so some time out of the house was well needed!</p>
                            <p>Now onto the future; Current plans for development work is attempting to upgrade the project to Netcode for GameObjects again, as well as finishing up all the equipable item system scripts. But why am I talking about the upgrade to Netcode for GameObjects so much? Well now that Unity has taken over the development of MLAPI they have started cleaning the system up from inside and out, fixed bugs and hopefully simplified some of the functionality. My first attempt to upgrade was a few weeks ago when the new version was fresh and documentation wasn't so great, the game was unplayable and sadly spent a while getting MLAPI installed again as they seem to be scrubbing this version from the internet now. Things are looking up though, there are a few videos available, research, blog post and slightly improved documentation means I'll be giving the upgrade another go, wish me luck!</p>
                            <p>Anyway, once these tasks above are eventually complete it's time to start creating a level, create some sort of simple Murder in the Dark gamemode and finally, it's ready for some mass testing with friends!</p>

                            <!-- Main post content -->
                            <p>Some more biggish changes to An Infestation this week, adding to the list of fundamental features I need available for the goals of the first proper version of this project. Like I mentioned a few weeks ago, the main goal at the moment is making a player-versus-player experience like my childhood favourite, the Friday night family classic, Murder In The Dark. If you haven't heard of Murder In The Dark, I'll give a quick explanation and then continue with the main changes for this version of An Infestation below. Let's begin.</p>
                            <p>Murder In The Dark is a simple party game, played at night, in pitch-black darkness, with two simple rules:</p>

                            <!-- Game Rules -->
                            <ol>
                                <li>If you're the Murderer, your task is to find everyone hiding and tag them with your torchlight.</li>
                                <li>If you're the hider, your mission is to find a hiding spot and hope you don't get caught.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <!-- Continue main post content -->
                            <p>My adaptation of this real-world game might have some differences, like allowing the actual killing of other players, but it will still follow the basic concept from above.</p>

                            <!-- First Paragraph For Section -->
                            <p>Now time for this week's changes! Nothing major or any new additions, but more reworks of current features getting the multiplayer treatment:</p>

                            <!-- Changes Bullet List -->
                            <ul>
                                <li>Fog Of War bug fixed where other players were exploring local player fog. Additionally, a fun accident occurred during the fix of this bug where there is now a slight outline of a local players fog in the light source of other players. I like how this turned out. It gives the player a sense of what they have explored.</li>
                                <li>Interactable objects are back, now working over multiplayer! Interaction with objects is an important feature, allowing for item pickups, chests and doors. The possibilities are endless.</li>
                                <li>Inventory appears to be working again, mainly with the ability to do item pickups. However, further testing will allow for different inventory interactions in a later version.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <!-- Continue Paragraph Section -->
                            <p>While there are still some additions to be made in the future, I am happy with what has been completed so far and think it's time I start recording versions of the game. Now that majority of the original game features are present in multiplayer, what better time than now to add an extra 1 to that filename. If anyone is reading this, give the prototype a try, and let me know what you think, including any bugs you find. Thank you!</p>

                            <p>Some major changes to An Infestation this week. Firstly, the project has been upgraded to the latest version of Unity from 2020.1.6f1 to 2021.1.24f1. This update allowed for the install of the latest version of MLAPI. The reason this update is necessary is that RPC calls and NetworkVariables weren't working correctly, turns out because I was accidentally using the version before Unity took over development. So after everything was updated and the code stitched back together, the script handling player colour changes is now working correctly and as intended, which leads directly into the next major change, and that's new colour variations for the players.</p>
                            <p>When a player connects, they will be assigned a colour for their player character at random. Each colour is unique and won't repeat unless every option has been exhausted to the available players, and thus, fresh colours are needed, and the List containing them refreshed. The reason this change took so long was because of the nature of its logic, this system needed to be run on the server so that all connecting players know what colours are remaining for assignment. Running code on the server is achieved using RPC calls and NetworkVariables, which ensure that altering the List of available colours or assigning colours to a player can only be performed by the server.</p>
                            <p>Unity update and some colour shifting are small changes in the grand scheme of things, but pretty decent changes to me. RPCs are something I will use more and more as time goes on with the development of An Infestation as a multiplayer game, so it's good to get a headstart.</p>

                            <h2 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom:25px;">AN ANNOYING LONG STORY, NOT ABOUT RPCS.</h2>
                            <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom:5px;">This is an experience I had with programming this week. It's a bit of a boring ramble but, what are blogs for...</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px; margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom:30px; color:#6985b8;">11:00 AM (AEST), October 12th, 2021</p>
                            
                            <!-- Main post content -->
                            <p>After last weeks post with the working FOV and online play, I decided it was time to wrap my head around RPC calls, and so I figured the random colour selection I wanted for each player would be a great feature to try this out. While it was a great idea to wrap my mind around RPC calls early, I didn't anticipate the amount of time this would take in the end.</p>
                            <p>So after reading through the documentation for MLAPI and watching a few videos, I thought I had the idea down and tried to implement it. Sadly no ice, no reaction from the code at all. My next thought was maybe it was the actual code for the colour changer. So I coded that for single-player and got it working, put it back on the server and still nothing. Something started to smell fishy, but I thought to myself, it must be something that I've done wrong, so I pushed past that feeling and continued. Back at the drawing board, I thought maybe the NetworkVariables weren't working as I was confident I was writing these RPC calls correctly. I removed all traces of RPC calls and made sure the code functioned from each individual player object instead, and again, it worked. Now I started to get annoyed. I wasn't doing anything wrong.</p>
                            <p>After a few more days of thinking and reading with nothing to show, I noticed something interesting. The version of MLAPI I was using had the RPC attributes declared as [ServerRPC], but in the documentation and videos, it was [ServerRpc]. I quickly realized it wasn't just [ServerRPC] either, GameObjects were all NetworkedObject instead of NetworkObject, and my synced variables were NetworkedVar instead of NetworkVariable. It turns out this whole time, using autofill to write these terms had hidden the problem right under my nose.</p>
                            <p>I upgraded Unity, removed the old MLAPI, installed the new MLAPI, spent several hours getting the project functioning again, and finally, it was again time to test my RPC calls. Well, you won't believe this, AGAIN it didn't work. However, there is still hope! I did get a different result this time, and this is the funniest part of programming. Sometimes you are trying to solve an issue, you might go down a path that has nothing to do with the problem, but then that path leads to an actual solution. Well, a Client connecting to the server was now setting the colour of the Host, which meant the RPC calls WERE working in the project, just not as intended. I had a new problem, a hilarious problem with all the added context of the story so far, and that was the RPC calls I was so confident about was wrong.</p>
                            <p>After some use of paper and actual planning for how I needed this system to work, I managed to wrap my head around what I needed and finally successfully implemented the colour change system. Essentially, the RPC calls were happening correctly but, the NetworkVariable I was using existed on every client, and I was setting that version instead of the server version.</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom:5px;">The successful hosting of a server over the internet, four players together and FOV working perfectly!</p>

                            <p>It's only been a few days since my last post where I successfully implemented multiplayer in my latest project, An Infestation, but in that time, I've got even more done! Almost half of the main features in the game are now working over a network, most notable being the Field Of View system; Which has everything from the shadow projection and basic Fog Of War effect to Toggling On and Off for some epic Hide'n'Seek action with other players! </p>
                            <p>Another notable change from a few days ago is the ability to host a game with a build and get my friends to connect over the internet during lockdown with nothing more than requiring port forwarding on my network. I successfully hosted and had four friends running around hiding in the dark. See the video above!</p>
                            <p>I know everything I am doing in the grand scheme of things is simple, but multiplayer has always been something I was scared of doing in my games development, so every tiny little detail I can achieve is huge to me, like a dream come true!</p>
                            <p>Anyway, just a small update today! While there is still lots of work, I am still rather proud of my efforts so far and look forward to getting the Fog Of War effect working fully, inventory and interactable items working and of course, shooting too!</p>

                            <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom:5px;">Using the power of MLAPI, I added multiplayer to my single-player game in a little over a day.</p>

                            <p>Now that the progress updates are out of the way, it's time to talk about the next project I started, and that's getting back into the development of An Infestation.</p>
                            <p>An Infestation is a game I worked on almost exactly a year ago. It was one of the first projects I started working on in Unity after finishing university and  I am very proud of it. Sadly I hadn't developed it further until this week because of a lack of motivation and ideas for how it could be fun. One thought that came to mind to address the fun problem was multiplayer; for something supposed to be scary, it might be fun to turn towards a player-versus-player experience like murder in the dark (A game I cherish from my childhood).</p>
                            <p>To get started, I needed to figure out how I would implement networking in my game. After a lot of research and experimentation with different techniques in Unity for multiplayer implementation, I settled on a simple solution called MLAPI, which seem to be the (new?) official system for doing networking in Unity. That's almost where this post ends; after a 15-minute video, I had it working! Obviously, the multiplayer isn't working 100% but still very impressive for something I was worried would take weeks.</p>
                            <p>Currently, the multiplayer of An Infestation consists of two player-controlled characters connecting over a network. Players can move and rotate independently, including the arm, and affect the Fog Of War of each connected client. The next plan for multiplayer features is full Field Of View and Fog Of War support with the vision cone (Players torch/light source) for each player, giving the game a sense of darkness and presence of other players in the world.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>I got started in MLAPI by following SRCoder's video he published as a part of a series on MLAPI. I only watched the first two parts for what I needed, but I highly recommend his videos, found them very helpful!</p>

                            <!-- Main post content -->
                            <p>Just a small update before main post today, I suddenly realised this morning that I haven't posted in a little while but have still been working on projects. So I thought I would make a small post with an update, but talk later about something I did yesterday just for some fun, which turned into multiplayer for my old An Infestation project.</p>
                            <p>Since my last post a month ago, a few things got done but not as much as I hoped. COVID19 and still being in lockdown has been an emotional rollercoaster, some days being hard to get motivated, but I have tried, and I'm happy with that at the very least.</p>
                            <p>Firstly I did some minor updates to the JamJar bot, published it on a few websites and got a nice amount of installs! After JamJar, I started looking into Discord.NET, an API for developing Discord bots in C#, but sadly I lost motivation without a clear idea for my next bot. Lastly, I started developing a custom 2D engine written in C++ as a hobby project, the idea being to keep my mind refreshed on the language. I'll post something on it soon.</p>

                            <!-- Main post content -->
                            <p>All I've wanted from these new lockdowns in Australia is to develop a new project or two, but ideas aren't flowing as well as they usually do when I can be out and about in the world being inspired by things. I decided the best solution for this was using a Game Jam to get inspired, which resulted in me thinking: "<i>How do they come up with themes? Generated right? Is there a Discord Bot, so I can always have it ready?</i>". Nope, it didn't look like there were any Discord Bots. <i>"I suppose I could make one and think of a game idea along the way!"</i>. (Spoilers: No game idea, but I did make a bot!)</p>
                            <p>So I do have some experience making Discord Bots. Last year I spent a night creating and learning how to create my first bot ImpostorBot, a bot created to take advantage of the Among Us trend and make it easier to invite players. I spent a week or so polishing up ImpostorBot, playing with different Discord features, and that was that. I haven't had another idea until now, which I was surprised to find that development was easy compared to the last. See, all this idea took was learning how to do JSON parsing, which is the same as I expected, and then getting a list of themes, genres and limitations to use for the random generation.</p>
                            <p>Genres and Limitations for the bot were easy to write; I wrote the Limitations myself and genres based on research of classic and modern-day genres used in the industry. However, the Themes list required a little more work. Initially, the development of the Themes list was manual and written by myself; this was slow and impractical. After some research of theme lists and other idea generators for game developers, I stumbled upon a project on itch.io by Gunnar Clovis; He had also made a theme generator, but instead of a Discord bot, he hosted it online. After a few email exchanges, he graciously allowed me to use his theme list, giving my bot millions of combinations along with the genres and limitations I had already written.</p>
                            <p>Please check out some of Gunnar's work: <a id="about-links" href="https://twitter.com/gunnarclovis">@GunnarClovis</a>.</p>
                            <p>After the database of ideas to generate was complete, there was nothing left to do but polish, name it and get it running on my Heroku server. Naming was pretty easy; I went with JamJar because its ideal usage is for game jams, so I thought the "Jam" of game jams is the ideas/themes part, and this bot is the "Jar" that holds it? I thought it was clever anyway.</p>

                            <!-- Continue main content -->
                            <p>Now to get it running on my Heroku server did involve some sad news. To have two bots cost money to run each month, meaning ImpostorBot is no more. There is still a bright side to ImpostorBot's demise. Hopefully, I can list this bot on directories for Discord bots AND actually get some servers installing this one!</p>
                            <p>It was a short but very fun and well worth project making JamJar! Hopefully, I can get it out into a few servers, as I honestly believe it's a fun little tool and very handy for other developers like me!</p>

                            <p>So I finally started a dev blog, a lot more effort than I first imagined, yet so simple...</p>
                            <p>For the longest time, I've wanted to create a blog. I wanted somewhere I could talk about my development, to help with my motivation, an insight into the development of a project once I progressed further, but equally important, a place to talk about my life or at least my nerdy life. The problem is, making a blog when you use GitHub Pages isn't as easy as it would seem, near impossible in the traditional sense.</p>
                            <p>See GitHub Pages is a static way to build a website, meaning you can't have databases, complicated designs, PHP or even run things like WordPress to handle the blog experience. Making a blog on GitHub Pages wasn't going to be easy, at least from what I could understand. I would most likely have to generate one locally, create a post through it and copy all the statically created files back into the Git repository each time I wanted to make a post. Generating the blog isn't the worst option, as projects like Jekyll can make this a simple and easy process. But I do feel like you lose a bit of control.</p>
                            <p>One of the main hurdles I found when trying Jekyll was getting it working with my current Website as I didn't want any rebuilds or redesigns to make it work. Sadly for me, it didn't seem worth that extra work and instead, I elected a basic approach with standard HTML and CSS to create a base post and blog page template and leave it at that.</p>
                            <p>It isn't all bad, I can use markdown to help create the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;h&gt; tags but yes, basically, I am writing a new page for every post, adding to the blog page for every post, all in HTML and its manual. However, it does keep things simple, still getting my hands dirty in code, even though it is only HTML, and I get to keep everything looking exactly how I like it. All in all, I did enjoy the experience of writing my first post using this method. It was fun.</p>
