                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Introduction:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Gypsy's Tale was a semester-long project that I developed with 7 other games development students under the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE). This was our final assessment task of the second year and developed in the Unity3D engine using C# as the language. I was the lead and sole programmer of this project, this was the first time I ever experienced that kind of responsibility for a project of this scale.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Gypsy's Tale is a small third-person adventure game, where players take control of Gypsy, an inquisitive, cheeky Golden Retriever. Run around and cause mischief in an inner-city park interacting with families, steal frisbees, finding bones and making friends.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Project Goals:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">The overall goal for Gypsy's Tale was to create a simple, relaxing and quick pick up walking simulation game. The idea was to play as a dog and do various activities around an inner-city park, keeping the gameplay light and focusing on the art. I think for the most part we achieved this goal, with the exception of adding a little more gameplay (Not as much as we hoped though).</p>

                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Lessons Learned:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">I learnt during the development process of Gypsy's Tale that working as a sole programmer is an incredibly intimidating, stressful and overwhelming job for a project of this scale. I felt that overall I did a pretty good job as a sole programmer but it was definitely an interesting realization to me for what this experience would be like.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Another thing I learnt during this assessment was how quickly a team can fall apart once people stop showing up. We were completely within scope for the team but quickly had to scope down many elements of the project to account for missing members. A couple of objectives and the player controller suffered greatly as a part of this issue.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Introduction:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Toy Wars was a 3-month long project developed with Unity and C# as a part of my studies at the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE). I developed this project with 6 other games development students that were also studying at AIE. This was our final assessment task of the first year, I worked with one other programmer on this project. The other programmer worked on the shooting mechanics and the soldier movement, while I worked on the turn manager, teddy bears, menus and other various scripts.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Toy Wars pits two hot-seated players against each other in a turn-based PvP combat environment. Both players have their own set of Toy Soldiers and must use them to destroy either their opponent's Soldiers or their Teddy Bear.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Project Goals:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">The overall goal for Toy Wars was to create a simple, turn-based, player versus player game that was inspired by worms and army men. The game was intended to be a 2 player hot seat with army soldiers and teddy bears acting as units for each player. The end goal was to kill all of the enemy units or destroy the enemy Teddy Bear before the other player did the same. The project had a few hiccups along the way but mostly turned out how we intended minus a few different weapons and unit types.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Lessons Learned:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">During the development of Toy Wars, I learnt many things about teamwork and scope. This was one of the first group game projects most of us had ever worked on and as a result, everyone was very excited. We thought we could do anything and quickly felt the pressure of how much work we had given ourselves, so we had to scope down a lot of ideas we had dramatically.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Things I thought were simple programming tasks didn't turn out to be so simple. Things like the turn manager I had implemented very quickly at the start of development and then moved on to other tasks. I thought I was more or less done. Quickly issues started to arise and I had to rethink my strategies, the turn manager got quickly complicated after that. I leanrt how important planning and research was when it came to things like this and that I shouldn't just assume something might be simple without confirming first.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Introduction:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Created in the Love2D engine using Lua, Zombie Game was one of the first real games that I ever created, I laugh when I see the code today. Regardless I am still very proud of what I achieved back in 2015 with this game, and I will be forever grateful for where it has pushed me.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">Zombie Game is a retro-style top-down zombie survival shooter. It's the story of a nameless survivor in an empty, desolate world with nothing but the clothes on his back and a loaded pistol to make it through the day. Learning from my mistakes with previous attempted games (Space Game, I'm very good with names as you can see), I decided to impose a time limit onto myself for when to have the basics of the game done. I also had more free time on my hands compared to the previous project (with school being over and low hours of work).</p>
                
                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Project Goals:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">The goal for Zombie Game was to have an actual functioning, fun game by the time limit I had given myself. It was to be a top-down shooter with endless spawning zombies and powerups, with the main goal being to survive as long as possible. </p>

                </ul>

                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Lessons Learned:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">I learned what it was like to work under a time limit, I felt the pressure and it made me realise what needed prioritising before others.
I learnt an understanding of the limitation of a game engine or platform.
The main lesson I would have learnt while creating this game is that when you love what you’re creating, you work a lot faster, have a lot of fun, learn and push yourself and the product a lot further.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Introduction:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">This was a project that I completed in my first-year studies at AIE to show my understanding and knowledge of Artificial Intelligence. The project is written in C++ and includes many code examples other than AI, for example, LinkedLists and Associative Arrays.</p>
                
                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Project Goals:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">The main goal of this assignment was to implement multiple artificial intelligence techniques within a graphical real-time application that runs a simulation with multiple A.I. controlled entities, demonstrating decision making, steering behaviours and pathfinding techniques.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">I also tried to make this a compilation piece of past assignments and work I had aceieved thus far at AIE, I was going to require a lot of other scripts  (container classes, for example) I had worked on in the previous assignments anyway so I thought a combination like this might be good. I would also like to show all of these other elements visually, so this is something not completed but still planned in the future of this piece. </p>

                <p style="text-align:left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;"><b>Lessons Learned:</b></p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">I didn' know too much about Artificial Intelligence as a topic before I started this assignment, other than it was software techniques to simulate intelligence. So as a result, for example, I learnt a lot about things I didn't even think were AI related at all like Navmeshes and flocking. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left;">During the development of this assignment, I also learnt a lot about different steering behaviours and pathfinding algorithms, I never realised how interesting it was and so in my spare time, I would love to be able to start messing around with that kind of stuff again. It was still a very challenging assignment for me personally but for some reason in my head I expected AI to be way more complicated than it is was, and so I found myself really enjoying this subject.</p>
